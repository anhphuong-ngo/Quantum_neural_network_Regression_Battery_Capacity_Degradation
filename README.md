This repository contains the supplementary material for the paper entitled "A Quantum Neural Network Regression for Modeling Lithium-ion Battery Capacity Degradation" published on IEEE Xplore: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10173794

In the repsitory, the code of following sections are provided:
1. Data collection for 12 Li-ion batteries (NASA)
2. Quantum neural network (QNN) Regression model
3. Implementation of QNN on Qulacs simulator
4. Visualization of Quantum circuit

News: In the 2nd version of QNN Regression, which will be uploaded with our upcoming publication in Variational Quantum Circuit, we will use a different model and platform.
